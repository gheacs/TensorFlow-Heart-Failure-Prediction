# Heart Failure Prediction

## Project Overview
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) stand as the leading cause of death globally, claiming approximately 17.9 million lives each year, which represents 31% of all global deaths. Among these, heart failure is a prevalent event, often resulting from various CVDs. This project aims to utilize machine learning to predict mortality due to heart failure, leveraging a dataset that encapsulates critical clinical features.

## Dataset Description
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, encompasses 12 features that are instrumental in forecasting heart failure mortality. These features include:
1. Age
2 Anaemia
3. Serum creatinine
4. Ejection fraction
5. Diabetes
6. High blood pressure
7. And other relevant clinical parameters
These attributes are crucial in assessing the likelihood of survival for patients suffering from heart failure.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the survival chances of heart failure patients based on their clinical data, thus aiding in early detection and proactive management of cardiovascular risk factors.
